## WebRTC Video Chat Application
A Facetime-like chat application utilizing WebRTC and web sockets.

## Description

Utilized WebRTC, a powerful JavaScript library capable of making web socket connections allowing for me to create a "Facetime" clone. WebRTC was used through Peer.js, a library that allows for easy WebRTC connections between two clients.
